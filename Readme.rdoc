== Welcome bot

A welcome bot for your chat room.  Will send a channel wide reply to a newly joined user and prompt them to use the "!help" command for a more information on the channel.

=== Running it

It runs with straight Ruby. You'll need the Cinch gem and Ruby 1.9, and you'll want to specify the nick and channel you want to use in a YAML file:

  bot.yaml
  settings:
    nick: my_bot
    channel: my_channel

Then just run it with

  ruby chatbot.rb
