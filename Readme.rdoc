== ChatBot

A community built chat bot, just for fun. Send pull requests!

=== Running it

It runs with straight Ruby. You'll need the Cinch gem, and you'll want to specify the nick and channels you want to use:

  ruby chatbot.rb -s irc.freenode.org -n ChatBot -C ecruby
  
C = Channels, comma separated for multiple channels
n = nickname
s = server

== Things we can do

* More games
* Database persistence
* Record links to Tumblr?
* Whatever else sounds like fun
